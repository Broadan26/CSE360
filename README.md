## CSE360Assignment2

Use the provided class template AddingMachine.java and make the following changes to the class

1. The add method should add the parameter to the total variable
2. The subtract method should subtract the parameter from the total variable
3. The getTotal method should return the current total
4. A history of transactions must be kept to be returned by the toString method. The history should start from initial 0.
Example: 
  test.add(4); test.subtract(2); test.add(5) should return "0 + 4 - 2 + 5" in the string and a value of 7 in the total.
5. The clear method clears the string and the current total.
